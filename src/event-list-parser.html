    Event Turn Format

    GENERAL DESCRIPTION
    ###################
    The Event Turn Format is a way to describe a sequence of events, TurnSequence.
    The format lists a series of Turns that are separated by whitespace.
    Each Turn can consist of a single TurnEvent or a TurnEventList.
    A TurnEventList is a series of TurnEvents separated by comma.

    Each TurnEvent consist of a TurnPrefix and an Event.
    The TurnPrefix specify the delay of the Event and the duration of the Event.
    If no TurnPrefix is specified, the
    default delay = 0 and default duration = 1.

    Each Event specify:
     - an EventName
     - a list of EventValues,
     - a list of EventProperties,
     - an EventTarget.

    The Target is the address for where the Event is to be sent from, similar to the Event.target in js.
    The goal or recipient of the Event is to be associated with the EventName, because
    it is likely to be several receivers of an Event and that receiver change from context to context.

    ATT!! All parts of the Event are optional. But, an Event must contain either one EventValue or the EventName.
    The EventName starts with $String. If there is no EventName,
    the first EventValue must begin with a letter not a Number [a-z_].

    A file describing EventSequences can list one or more EventSequences.
    The file also contains another lists of DefaultPropertiesObject.
    Each DefaultPropertiesObjects is specified as a json object:
    "DefaultPropertiesObjectName": {
        "prop1": "value1",
        "prop2": 2,
    }
    If the DefaultPropertiesObjectName starts with @,
        then the default values should apply to Events with this EventTarget.
    Else, the DefaultPropertiesObject should apply to Events with EventNames
        that match should apply to Events the DefaultPropertiesObjectName

    DefaultPropertiesObjects are added in json,
    and there can only be one DefaultPropertiesObject for each DefaultPropertiesObjectName.
    The last one read will overwrite any previous DefaultPropertiesObject with the same DefaultPropertiesObjectName.

    If an Event has a DefaultPropertiesObject for both its EventName and its EventTarget,
    the DefaultPropertiesObject for the EventName is added first, thus giving property types for any EventValues
    that are not specified in the Event itself, and then the DefaultPropertiesObject for the EventTarget is added.
    The DefaultPropertiesObject for the EventTarget is thus given priority and overwrite the default settings for
    the EventName.

    TurnSequence = Turn Turn Turn
    Turn = TurnEvent | TurnEventList
    TurnEventList = TurnEvent,TurnEvent,TurnEvent

    TurnEvent = [TurnPrefix]Event
    TurnPrefix = [EventDelay][EventDuration]
    EventDelay = Number+
    EventDuration = Number

    Event = EventName[EventValues][?EventProperties][@EventTarget] | EventName[EventValues][?EventProperties][@EventTarget]
    EventName = String that does not start with a legal Number character.
    EventValueList = [:[EventValue]]*
    EventValue = Number | String.
    EventPropertyList = ?[EventProperty[:[EventProperty]]*]
    EventProperty = String.
    EventTarget = @EventTargetName
    EventTargetName = String.

    String = any character that is not Whitespace, ',', :, @ or ?.
    Number = [0123456789.-/^%]+

    Examples:
    A song:          C:1 C:1 C:1 G D D F A A B B F F G:2 _
            defaults: $playTone{tone: "C", octave:3, volume:0.8}, @piano{octave:4}
            would result in the first event output: 0+1$playTone:C:5:0.8?tone:octave:volume@piano
    default
    A ChessGame:
    A complex note.  0.5+2$playTone:G:4?octave@piano

    delay+durationARG:ARG:ARG@type?prop:prop:prop

    word word word word,word word word word,word,word word
    " " space separates each word
    "," separates words that are to be understood as on the same time, played synchronously.

    Tip, special command events are often added after a comma on the previous event, so that it is not given a separate turn.

    Each word is constructed as follows:
    [delay+][duration]NAME[:ARG][:ARG][@macro]


    [Prefix]WORD[Postfix]           prefix and postfix are optional

    Prefix = [Delay+][Duration]     both delay and duration are optional.
                                    Delay always ends with a "+".
                                    Delay is always in front of duration.

    WORD = [ARG][:ARG]*             All args that can be converted to a number, will be converted to a number.
                                    This also applies to "1/8" which might be beneficial to keep as strings..
                                    they are converted now, this might need to be altered later.

    Postfix = [@type][?prop:prop]
    Postfix = [?prop[:prop]*][@type]
                                    All types can be described in json as follows:
                                    typename : {name1 : defaultvalue1, name2 : defaultvalue2, etc}.

                                    The result is as follows: You can have
                                    a)
                                    event = "g:1",
                                    type = @piano,
                                    "piano" : {"octave": 0, "volume": 0.8}
                                    =>
                                    "g:1:0.8@piano?octave:volume"
                                    b)
                                    event = "g:1@piano?volume",
                                    type = @piano,
                                    "piano" : {"octave": 0, "volume": 0.8}
                                    =>
                                    "g:1:0@piano:volume:octave"

    Numbers.                        All units that consists only of the characters "0123456789.-/^%"
    NAME                            starts with a-zA-Z_$ and ends at the first ":@ " (Colon, at and space).
                                    Any argument that consists only of Number characters are parsed as a number.


    examples:
    0.5+2G:v.8@guitar => wait half a turn until you play a note G with a duration of 2 turns on the guitar
    $s:.5 => set the speed to hald (.5)
    $r:4:2 => repeat the four last turns two more times

    a song:
    c1 c1 c1 g a a 2g _ e1 e1

    The space separate the turns. If each turn is half a second long,
    then each turn will be delayed by half a second from the start of the
    previous turn. That will produce a rythmic sound.
    If played by a piano, this would be the start of "old macDonald had a farm".
    It could also be played by a game engine that initiates enemy spaceships
    type "c", "g", "a" etc from direction default=top, 1=left.

    TODO: Should we add "-" to describe events that are to be played sequentially, one after the other?
    TODO: right now it is not made a specific decision if there can be more ARGs than PROPs, if some of the props are defined.

    The filters of events can reduce the values, but more likely they just add more values to the event.
    And then it is only a point when we compare two events that we have the same property to compare against.
    So this could be a general "event comparator", in which we just need to specify against which properties
    we are comparing.
    That would result in an event distance object. This is the distance between certain properties in two events.
